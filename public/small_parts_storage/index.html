        <p>I've accumulated a huge number of screws, drills, driver bits, and other random hardware. And keeping all of this hardware organized and easy to find has always been an ongoing battle. When possible, I like to keep the hardware in its original container; often, the hardware is sold in small, sturdy-enough boxes with clear labels. And these small, roughly uniformly sized boxes are easy to keep organized.</p>
<p>But not all hardware comes in such a container. Sometimes, if I'm only buying a handful of fasteners, the fasteners come in a little plastic bag. On the other extreme, when I buy my most frequently used fasteners in bulk, I don't want to lug around a heavy bin with thousands of screws when I'll only need a few.</p>
<p>I've been inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRVSI4I9YTI&amp;ab_channel=RonPaulk">Ron Paulk's heavy use of Viewtainers</a> for organizing his hardware collection. And Viewtainers are fantastic, but only come in a handful of sizes. And at about five dollars per viewtainer, his drawer of about 50 containers has $250 worth of containers. It's hard to find faults with Ron's hardware organization though. All of his hardware has an easy to find home, making it quick to locate the hardware he needs and equally quick to put away unused fasteners during cleanup.</p>
<p>I've found a solution that works well for me without needing hundreds of dollars worth of plastic tubes: making my own tube-tainers. Big-box home improvement shops sell <a href="https://www.engproducts.com/products/lighting/tube-guards">clear plastic fluorescent tube guards</a> that are easy to cut to size with scissors. And McMaster-Carr sells vinyl caps that fit the ends of the t8 and t12 tube guards: <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/9753K395/">part number 9753K395</a> fits the t8 tube guards, and part <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/9753K434/">number 9753K434</a> fits the t12 tube guards. A pair of these caps ranges from 42 cents for the t8 caps to about a dollar for th t12 caps. And a four foot tube guard costs about four dollars for either size.</p>
<p>These homemade tube-tainers aren't quite as durable as the viewtainers, and there aren't any sizes as wide as the Viewtainers, but they're a fraction of the cost, which quickly adds up when you're organizing dozens of different kinds of hardware.</p>
